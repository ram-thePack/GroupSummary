Yet, somehow, millions of people do this every day! So, how do we go from being two beings of different species with no common language to communicating effortlessly and coexisting harmoniously? The key to achieving this lies in your dog’s behaviour and how well you understand it. Before we delve into understanding your dogs’ behaviour, let’s first understand what behaviour is. If we refer to the dictionary, behaviour is a response to stimuli, and yes, in essence, it is that. However, in the context of domestic dog-human relationships, with their lack of verbal language, behaviour is, more importantly, a means of communication. It is the crux of your relationship with your dog."

This makes Akasa the second airline after Air India to allow pet dogs and cats in the cabin. Traditionally, the experience of booking tickets and getting permissions for your pets with Air India has always been a hassle, at least before the Tata takeover. We sincerely hope that Akasa can make the process and the journey a lot more seamless and simple for pets and parents. With that in mind, we decided to dig deeper into Akasa Air’s pet travel policy to declutter the process for you.
